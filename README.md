# SQL Data Warehouse, Analytics & Power BI Project

🚀 A complete end-to-end project that covers data warehousing, SQL-based analytics, and business intelligence dashboards.
The project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful business insights using:

SQL Server for Data Warehouse & ETL

SQL for Analytics & Reporting

Power BI for Interactive Dashboards

📂 **Project Overview**

This project is divided into three main parts:

1️⃣ **Data Warehouse (SQL Server)**

Built a Modern Data Warehouse using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).

ETL Pipelines: Loaded raw CSV data into SQL Server, applied cleansing & transformations.

Data Modeling: Designed fact and dimension tables using a Star Schema.

2️⃣ **SQL Analytics & Reporting**

Developed SQL queries to generate insights on:

report_customers.sql → Customer segmentation and sales contribution.

report_products.sql → Product performance and top products analysis.

3️⃣ **Power BI Dashboard**

Designed an interactive BI dashboard to visualize insights from the Data Warehouse.

📊 The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore sales performance, track KPIs, and identify growth opportunities.

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

SQL Server (Express & SSMS) → Data Warehouse & ETL

SQL → Data Analytics & Reporting

Power BI → Visualization & Dashboarding

Draw.io → Data Architecture & Schema Design

📌 **Key Deliverables**

✔️ Modern Data Warehouse (Bronze–Silver–Gold)
✔️ Optimized SQL queries for analytics
✔️ Interactive Power BI dashboard
